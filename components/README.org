#+title: components

* Info

This directory contains 

This directory contains most of what makes up neko-emacs, in the form of modules/components. It is categorized into the following subdirectories:
- core :: contains modules that are required for everything to work nicely.
- modules :: contains everything else. Everything there is optional but most are loaded by default for a "just-works" experience out of the box.

* Organization

** core
The modules here are loaded from =init.el= and set up core components like package manager, use-package, no-littering, and etc. You are able to blacklist, substitute, and add modules to this list of modules, but be careful when doing so.

** modules
The modules here are all-encompassing and range from pre-configured completion frameworks, support for various programming languages, theming, and more. Most of these are enabled by default to provide a just-works experience. You can specify which ones to loaded in =personal/nekomimi/modules.el=.
