  ;; Add a song to a playlist:
  ;; - steps:
  ;;   - create a new playlist buffer named "%s_real".
  ;;   - place the song at the bottom of the playlist.
  ;;   - make modifications as needed.
  ;;   - command to write and delete buffer.
  ;;   
  ;;
  ;; workflow:
  ;; - idea: if playing a playlist (any) and i want to add a song from it to a specific playlist (regardless of if it's loaded or not), the process is to load the playlist from the file in a new buffer, make the change, save, then close. And for convenience, if that playlist i added the song in is loaded and i wanna see those changes be updated, run a function to reload the playlist from its source file.
